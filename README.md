# VoltScript Volt MX Middleware

Libraries for integrating with Volt MX Foundry.

## Using dependency management

Dependency management is available in the documentation for each project, but also aggregated here:

### Authentication

You'll need a [Personal Access Token](../howto/writing/archipelago.md#github-personal-access-token) to use GitHub REST APIs. You'll then need to add this to the JSON object in your [atlas-settings.json](../howto/writing/archipelago.md#atlas-settingsjson), in the .vss directory of your user home directory:

```json
    "hcl-github": {
        "type": "github",
        "token": "${env.TOKEN}"
    }
```

### Repository

You'll need to add to your **repositories** object in the atlas.json of your project:

```json
        {
            "id": "hcl-github",
            "type": "github",
            "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE"
        }
```

### Dependency

You'll need the relevant dependency to add to your **dependencies** or **testDependencies** object in the atlas.json of your project:

```json
        {
            "library": "voltscript-voltmx-middleware",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "module": "VoltMXObjects.vss",
            "repository": "hcl-github"
        }
```

## VoltMXObjects

VoltMXObjects is used for parsing the JSON object sent by a Foundry integration service (also also used behind the scenes in pre/postprocessors). The key objects are exposed as global properties. The JSON object will be passed as the context and accessed via ContextVSE:

```voltscript
Dim ctx as New Context()
data = ctx.context
```

The `extractObjects()` function will then parse the JSON object and populate the variables.

### Error Handling and Returning Context

The return output should be a JSON object **and only the JSON object**. This should be `VoltMxResult.toJson()`. Errors should be passed by call `VoltMxResult.setError()`.
