# Welcome to VoltScript Volt MX Middleware documentation

VoltScript Volt MX Middleware is VoltScript files for integrating with [HCL Volt MX Go](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/voltmxgo-documentation/index.html){: target="blank"}. Currently, the only library available is **VoltMXObjects.vss**. It's a library for use in Volt MX Foundry integration services for parsing the request content coming into Foundry and passing a JSON result back. In future enhancements, there might be a VoltScript library for making requests to Foundry.

/Currently, the only library available is **VoltMXObjects.vss**, a library for use in Volt MX Foundry integration services, for parsing the request content coming into Foundry and passing a JSON result back. However, it is anticipated that future enhancements may include a VoltScript library for making requests to Foundry./

To manage the content coming from Foundry, there are various dependencies:

- **ContextVSE** is for parsing the JSON object passed from Foundry.
- **JSONVSE** is necessary for manipulating JSON objects used in communication.
- **VoltScript Collections** is for facilitating easier interaction by enabling incoming content to be parsed into Maps.
- **VoltScript Testing** is only a dependency for unit testing of the framework and isn't a runtime dependency.
